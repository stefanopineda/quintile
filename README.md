# Quintile

**Keyboard-only grid tiling for macOS.** Define any N×M grid per display, place
windows on any rectangular span of cells in two keypresses, and move them
around the grid — without ever touching the mouse.

Quintile is free, MIT-licensed, and built on the public Accessibility API
only: no SIP disabling, no scripting-addition injection, no private
frameworks. It survives macOS updates the same way Rectangle and AeroSpace do.

## Why Quintile

Most tiling tools stop at halves, quarters, and thirds. Quintile treats your
display as an arbitrary grid (say, 5×2 on a 32" monitor) and gives you a
keyboard-driven picker for *any rectangular span* of that grid — the top-left
2×1, the middle three columns, whatever your workflow wants.

No dedicated, zero-config tiling app ships an interactive keyboard N×M span
picker. The closest prior art is Hammerspoon's excellent `hs.grid` — which
requires writing Lua. Quintile gives you that interaction out of the box.

*Comparison reflects each product's published feature set at the time of
writing; corrections welcome.*

Keyboard-only is a permanent product principle, not a missing feature: no
mouse-drag snap zones, ever. A smaller, all-keyboard surface is what makes
the shortcuts stick.

## Install

**Homebrew:**

```sh
brew install --cask stefanopineda/quintile/quintile
```

**Manual:** download `Quintile.app` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/stefanopineda/quintile/releases), move it
to `/Applications`, and launch it.

**From source** (Command Line Tools are enough — no Xcode needed):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stefanopineda/quintile
cd quintile && make run
```

### Granting Accessibility permission

Quintile moves windows through the macOS Accessibility API, which requires a
one-time permission grant:

1. Launch Quintile — the onboarding window appears and macOS shows the
   permission prompt.
2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility** (the
   onboarding window's button takes you straight there).
3. Enable **Quintile** in the list.

The menu-bar icon shows `⊞!` until permission is granted. That's the only
permission Quintile ever asks for — no Screen Recording, no network.

## The grid picker

![Grid-select overlay demo](docs/demos/grid-select.gif)

Press `⌃⌥G` and the grid overlay appears on your focused window's display,
with a key label in every cell:

- **Two keypresses** place the window: first key sets one corner, second key
  sets the opposite corner — the window fills the span between them.
  Same key twice = that single cell.
- Or refine with **arrows** (move), **⇧+arrows** (extend a span),
  **⏎** (confirm), **esc** (cancel).

## Shortcuts

All shortcuts use the `⌃⌥` (Control+Option) leader. The full list also lives
in the app: **menu bar → Shortcuts…**

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Grid picker (span selection) | `⌃⌥G` |
| Move window one cell | `⌃⌥←` `⌃⌥→` `⌃⌥↑` `⌃⌥↓` |
| Quadrants (TL / TR / BL / BR) | `⌃⌥1` … `⌃⌥4` |
| Thirds (left / center / right) | `⌃⌥[` `⌃⌥]` `⌃⌥\` |
| Sixths (thirds × top/bottom) | `⌃⌥⇧1` … `⌃⌥⇧6` |
| Cycle grid profile for current display | `⌃⌥P` |
| Send window to next display | `⌃⌥N` |

![Presets and move demo](docs/demos/presets-move.gif)

Moving a window into occupied cells relocates the occupants into the space
you vacated — sizes preserved, no windows lost off-grid. At a grid edge the
move is a no-op with a soft feedback cue, so you always know the keystroke
registered.

## Grid profiles

![Profile cycling demo](docs/demos/profiles.gif)

Every display carries three named grid profiles — **standard** (5×2 by
default), **secondary** (2×2), **tertiary** (3×2) — each independently
editable in Preferences (up to 10×4). `⌃⌥P` cycles the active profile for
the display holding your focused window and flashes the new grid so you can
see what you switched to. Cycling never moves your windows; it changes what
the grid *means* for the next placement.

Profiles are remembered per display — by hardware identity, not port — so
your 32" monitor keeps its 5×2 whether it's plugged into the dock or direct.

## macOS's own tiling shortcuts

macOS binds `Fn+Ctrl+Arrow` to its built-in half/quarter tiling. Quintile
ships an experimental "take over macOS tiling shortcuts" mode (off by
default) that intercepts those chords. Reliability varies by macOS version;
the dependable route is to disable the built-in shortcuts in **System
Settings → Keyboard** and let Quintile observe the chords — see the notes in
`Sources/QuintileCore/Hotkeys/SystemShortcutBridge.swift`.

## Troubleshooting

- **A window won't move or resize.** Some Electron and Java apps reject
  Accessibility resize requests. Quintile surfaces the failure (menu-bar
  flash) instead of silently doing nothing — the window, not Quintile, is
  declining.
- **Display forgets its profiles behind a KVM or dock.** Some KVMs/docks
  mangle the display serial number, so identity falls back to name +
  resolution; two identical serial-less monitors can collide. Known
  limitation for v1.
- **Hotkeys stopped working after revoking/re-granting permission.**
  Re-grant in System Settings; Quintile re-arms its event tap automatically
  on the next permission check (within ~3 s).

## Building & releasing

- `make test` — full test suite (no permissions needed; AX and event-tap
  layers are tested against fakes behind protocol seams).
- `make app` — assembles `dist/Quintile.app` (ad-hoc signed) from the SPM
  build; see `Scripts/build-app.sh`.
- Real releases must be signed with a **Developer ID Application** identity
  and **notarized** (`CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: …" make app`,
  then `notarytool`). Unsigned builds are Gatekeeper-blocked, and App
  Translocation breaks the Accessibility grant between launches.
